-- Task IO-1.
--
-- The function 'read' is the counterpart of 'show'.
-- Its type is
--
--   read :: Read a => String -> a
--
-- It tries to parse the string as a type, depending on
-- context.
--
-- For example, the following function tries to
-- parse a string to an integer simply by restricting
-- the type signature of 'read'. Unfortunately, 'read'
-- will crash if we call it on a malformed string.
--
-- Try both a successful and an unsuccessful call to
-- 'unsafeReadInt' in GHCi.

unsafeReadInt :: String -> Int
unsafeReadInt = read

-- Task IO-2.
--
-- The function 'readMaybe', defined in the module
-- 'Text.Read', fixes this problem by returning a
-- 'Maybe' result instead. Define a safe version of
-- 'readInt' by using it.

-- Task IO-3.
--
-- Implement the IO action 'readLnMaybe' that reads a
-- line from the user, and tries to convert it into
-- a value of another readable type via 'readMaybe'.
--
-- Hint: Use 'liftM'.

readLnMaybe :: Read a => IO (Maybe a)
readLnMaybe = error "TODO: implement readLnMaybe"

-- Task IO-4.
--
-- Write a program that asks the user to input a number, and after that
-- number has been provided, a second number, and then replies with the
-- sum of both numbers.
--
-- Example:
--
--   Please enter first number:
--   12
--   Please enter second number:
--   23
--   The sum of both numbers is 35.
--
-- Hint: Use 'readLn' for reading the inputs. Remember that
--
--   show :: Show a => a -> String
--
-- can be used to convert a number back into a string. Also
-- remember that strings are lists of characters.

sumTwo :: IO ()
sumTwo = error "TODO: define sumTwo"

-- Task IO-5.
--
-- Define a function that, given a number n and an IO action, constructs
-- a new IO action that executes the original action n times, collecting
-- the results in a list of n elements.

replicateM :: Int -> IO a -> IO [a]
replicateM = error "TODO: define replicateM"

-- Task IO-6.
--
-- Define a program that first asks the user to provide the number of
-- items to add. Then, if the user enters N, the program should ask for
-- N numbers. Once these have been entered, the program should return
-- the result.
--
-- Example:
--
--   How many numbers do you want to add?
--   3
--   Enter next number:
--   10
--   Enter next number:
--   1
--   Enter next number:
--   7
--   The sum of all numbers is 18.
--
-- Hint: Try to use suitable IO functions.

sumMany :: IO ()
sumMany = error "TODO: define sumMany"

-- Task IO-7.
--
-- Change 'sumMany' such that when asking for each number,
-- an indication of progress is given.
--
--   How many numbers do you want to add?
--   3
--   Enter number 1 of 3:
--   10
--   Enter number 2 of 3:
--   1
--   Enter number 3 of 3:
--   7
--   The sum of all numbers is 18.
--
-- Hint: You cannot use 'replicateM' for this. But perhaps
-- you can still find higher-order functions that work?

sumMany' :: IO ()

-- Task IO-8.
--
-- Define a function akin to the Unix utility wc (word count) that for a
-- given file, returns the number of lines, of words, and of characters
-- in that file.
--
-- Note that
--
--   type FilePath = String

--
-- Define an IO action that "rolls two (6-sided) dice" and returns the
-- two results as a pair.
--
-- Use the function
--
--   randomRIO :: Random a => (a, a) -> IO a
--
-- from the module System.Random (which you will have to add to the
-- import list).
--
-- It takes a range as an input, i.e., the minimal and maximal value

-- The following datatype defines the abstract syntax of a language
-- of dice expressions.
--
-- For example, in an imagined concrete syntax, the string

--
-- stands for "roll two 8-sided dice and add 4". The abstract
-- representation of this expression is
--
--   2 `D` 8 `Plus` Const 4

-- Define an evaluator 'dice' that uses a random number generator
-- to produce a result.

-- Task IO-10.
--
-- Define another function on the 'Dice' type called 'diceRange'
-- that returns the minimal and maximal random value that could

-- Task IO-11.
--
-- Shuffle a deck of cards (or any other list).
--
-- Here's a standard naive algorithm:
--
-- To shuffle a list, pick a random number that is a valid index into the
-- list. Remove the element from the list and make it the first element of
-- the shuffled list. Then recurse on the shorter list. Once the empty list
-- is reached, stop.
--
-- You may need to write a function
--
--   extract :: Int -> [a] -> (a, [a]) -- possibly crashing
--
-- that finds the element contained in a list at a particular index
-- and returns it together with the rest of the list.
-- (A better data structure for this kind of operation would be a sequence.)
--
-- The following data types are just given for flavour:

data Suit = Clubs | Spades | Hearts | Diamonds
  deriving (Show, Eq, Bounded, Enum)

data CardNumber = A | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 | C10 | J | Q | K
  deriving (Show, Eq, Bounded, Enum)
